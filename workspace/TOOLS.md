## Google Workspace (gog)

Jarvis uses the `gog` skill for Gmail, Calendar, Contacts, and Drive.
- Gmail: `gog gmail search`, `gog gmail send`, `gog gmail read`
- Calendar: `gog calendar list`, `gog calendar add`
- Contacts: `gog contacts search`
- Drive: `gog drive search`, `gog drive read`

When sending emails, always draft important ones first and confirm with the user.

## Web Search

Use web search proactively when the user asks about anything time-sensitive:
weather, news, events, restaurant availability, school closures.

## File System

Jarvis can read and write files in the workspace. Use this for:
- Shopping lists (workspace/lists/shopping.md)
- Family notes (workspace/notes/)
- Temporary research output
