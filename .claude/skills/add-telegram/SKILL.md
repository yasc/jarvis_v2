# Add Telegram Channel

This skill adds Telegram support to NanoClaw using the skills engine for deterministic code changes, then walks through interactive setup.

## Phase 1: Pre-flight

### Check if already applied

Read `.nanoclaw/state.yaml`. If `telegram` is in `applied_skills`, skip to Phase 3 (Setup). The code changes are already in place.

### Ask the user

1. **Mode**: Replace WhatsApp or add alongside it?
   - Replace → will set `TELEGRAM_ONLY=true`
   - Alongside → both channels active (default)

2. **Do they already have a bot token?** If yes, collect it now. If no, we'll create one in Phase 3.

## Phase 2: Apply Code Changes

Run the skills engine to apply this skill's code package. The package files are in this directory alongside this SKILL.md.

### Initialize skills system (if needed)

If `.nanoclaw/` directory doesn't exist yet:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/apply-skill.ts --init
```

Or call `initSkillsSystem()` from `skills-engine/migrate.ts`.

### Apply the skill

```bash
npx tsx scripts/apply-skill.ts .claude/skills/add-telegram
```

This deterministically:
- Adds `src/channels/telegram.ts` (TelegramChannel class implementing Channel interface)
- Adds `src/channels/telegram.test.ts` (46 unit tests)
- Three-way merges Telegram support into `src/index.ts` (multi-channel support, findChannel routing)
- Three-way merges Telegram config into `src/config.ts` (TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_ONLY exports)
- Three-way merges updated routing tests into `src/routing.test.ts`
- Installs the `grammy` npm dependency
- Updates `.env.example` with `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_ONLY`
- Records the application in `.nanoclaw/state.yaml`

If the apply reports merge conflicts, read the intent files:
- `modify/src/index.ts.intent.md` — what changed and invariants for index.ts
- `modify/src/config.ts.intent.md` — what changed for config.ts

### Validate code changes

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

All tests must pass (including the new telegram tests) and build must be clean before proceeding.

## Phase 3: Setup

### Create Telegram Bot (if needed)

If the user doesn't have a bot token, tell them:

> I need you to create a Telegram bot:
>
> 1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
> 2. Send `/newbot` and follow prompts:
>    - Bot name: Something friendly (e.g., "Andy Assistant")
>    - Bot username: Must end with "bot" (e.g., "andy_ai_bot")
> 3. Copy the bot token (looks like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`)

Wait for the user to provide the token.

### Configure environment

Add to `.env`:

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<their-token>
```

If they chose to replace WhatsApp:

```bash
TELEGRAM_ONLY=true
```

Sync to container environment:

```bash
mkdir -p data/env && cp .env data/env/env
```

The container reads environment from `data/env/env`, not `.env` directly.

### Disable Group Privacy (for group chats)

Tell the user:

> **Important for group chats**: By default, Telegram bots only see @mentions and commands in groups. To let the bot see all messages:
>
> 1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
> 2. Send `/mybots` and select your bot
> 3. Go to **Bot Settings** > **Group Privacy** > **Turn off**
>
> This is optional if you only want trigger-based responses via @mentioning the bot.

### Build and restart

```bash
npm run build
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw
```

## Phase 4: Registration

### Get Chat ID

Tell the user:

> 1. Open your bot in Telegram (search for its username)
> 2. Send `/chatid` — it will reply with the chat ID
> 3. For groups: add the bot to the group first, then send `/chatid` in the group

Wait for the user to provide the chat ID (format: `tg:123456789` or `tg:-1001234567890`).

### Register the chat

Use the IPC register flow or register directly. The chat ID, name, and folder name are needed.

For a main chat (responds to all messages, uses the `main` folder):

```typescript
registerGroup("tg:<chat-id>", {
  name: "<chat-name>",
  folder: "main",
  trigger: `@${ASSISTANT_NAME}`,
  added_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  requiresTrigger: false,
});
```

For additional chats (trigger-only):

```typescript
registerGroup("tg:<chat-id>", {
  name: "<chat-name>",
  folder: "<folder-name>",
  trigger: `@${ASSISTANT_NAME}`,
  added_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  requiresTrigger: true,
});
```

## Phase 5: Verify

### Test the connection

Tell the user:

> Send a message to your registered Telegram chat:
> - For main chat: Any message works
> - For non-main: `@Andy hello` or @mention the bot
>
> The bot should respond within a few seconds.

### Check logs if needed

```bash
tail -f logs/nanoclaw.log
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding

1. Check `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set in `.env` AND synced to `data/env/env`
2. Check chat is registered: `sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT * FROM registered_groups WHERE jid LIKE 'tg:%'"`
3. For non-main chats: message must include trigger pattern
4. Service is running: `launchctl list | grep nanoclaw`

### Bot only responds to @mentions in groups

Group Privacy is enabled (default). Fix:
1. `@BotFather` > `/mybots` > select bot > **Bot Settings** > **Group Privacy** > **Turn off**
2. Remove and re-add the bot to the group (required for the change to take effect)

### Getting chat ID

If `/chatid` doesn't work:
- Verify token: `curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getMe"`
- Check bot is started: `tail -f logs/nanoclaw.log`

## After Setup

Ask the user:

> Would you like to add Agent Swarm support? Each subagent appears as a different bot in the Telegram group. If interested, run `/add-telegram-swarm`.
